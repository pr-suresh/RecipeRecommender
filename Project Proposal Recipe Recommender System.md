## Recipe Recommender System

The goal of this project is to provide personalized recipe recommendations for a person given their preferences in past recipes. This can help people to discover new recipes that they may want to try which in turn helps in planning grocery trips!

The Dataset for this project consists of 180K+ recipes and 700K+ recipe reviews covering 18 years of user interactions and uploads on Food.com from Kaggle[https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_recipes.csv]. I will be working with the text content in recipes and their reviews.

### Tools
Data wrangling: Numpy, Pandas
Text processing:NLTK and spaCy
Visualizations: Seaborn, Matplotlib

### MVP Goal
For MVP, I will be presenting a version of the topic modeling and some visualizations
